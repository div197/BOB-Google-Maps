## üöÄ Usage

### Running an Extraction Specialist
```bash
python3 scripts/architecture_firms_specialist.py
python3 scripts/healthcare_facilities_leads.py
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python3 scripts/test_extraction.py
python3 scripts/test_simple.py
bash scripts/test_imports.sh
```

### Debugging Issues
```bash
python3 scripts/debug_extraction.py
```

## üîß Development

### Creating New Extraction Scripts
1. Follow the specialist pattern from existing scripts
2. Include proper error handling
3. Add documentation and usage examples
4. Test thoroughly before committing

### Script Template
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script Description - BOB Google Maps v3.4.1
Purpose and capabilities
"""

# Standard imports
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add parent to path for imports
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))

from bob import HybridExtractor

# Implementation
```

## üìã Best Practices

1. **Keep It Focused**: Each script should have a clear, specific purpose
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with informative error messages
3. **Documentation**: Include docstrings and usage comments
4. **Logging**: Use structured logging for debugging
5. **Testing**: Include test cases or verification code

## üîÑ Integration

Scripts in this directory are:
- **Autonomous**: Can be run independently
- **Reusable**: Can be imported and used in other scripts
- **Testable**: Include verification and error checking
- **Documented**: Clear purpose and usage

## üìä Performance Expectations

- Typical extraction: 6-8 seconds per business
- With rate limiting (20s): 26-28 seconds per business
- Memory usage: 17-56MB per extraction
- Success rate: 95%+ on real data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```bash
bash scripts/test_imports.sh
```

### Extraction Failures
```bash
python3 scripts/debug_extraction.py
```
