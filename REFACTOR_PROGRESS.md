## 📝 DECISIONS MADE

### Architecture Decision (Step 5 - Pre-decided):
**Decision:** Move extractors to `bob_v3/extractors/` (Option A)

**Rationale:**
1. Proper package structure
2. Clean imports: `from bob_v3.extractors import PlaywrightExtractor`
3. Pip installable
4. Pythonic convention

**Alternative Rejected:**
- Keep in `src/core/` with wrappers (hacky, confusing)
