```python
# New business-only extraction options
scraper = GoogleMapsScraper(extract_reviews=False)  # Business-only mode
scraper = GoogleMapsScraper(max_reviews=10)         # Limited reviews
result = scraper.scrape_business_only(url)          # Dedicated method

# Enhanced batch processing
from bob_core.batch import batch_scrape
results = batch_scrape(urls, extract_reviews=False, max_workers=4)
```
