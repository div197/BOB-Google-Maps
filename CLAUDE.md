## Development Philosophy

### Nishkaam Karma Yoga Principles
As taught in the Bhagavad Gita, this project follows the path of selfless action:

1. **Action without attachment to results** - Code written for excellence, not ego
2. **Dedication to the divine** - Every line offered as service
3. **Focus on dharma** - Right action, ethical scraping
4. **Continuous improvement** - 108-step journey of refinement
5. **Service to community** - Open source contribution

### The 108-Step Journey
- **Steps 1-36:** Foundation and core extraction
- **Steps 37-72:** Advanced features and optimization
- **Steps 73-108:** Testing, documentation, and polish
- Each step represents a bead on the mala of development

### Technical Excellence Through Spiritual Practice
```python
# Example: Service-oriented code
class GoogleMapsScraper:
    """Scraper built with dedication and detachment"""

    def scrape(self, query):
        """Perform scraping as seva (service)"""
        # Action without attachment to results
        result = self._extract_with_care(query)
        return result  # Offer results without ego
```

## Critical Issues & Fixes Needed

### 🚨 Priority 1: SQLite Cache Fix
**Issue:** `Python int too large to convert to SQLite INTEGER`
**Root Cause:** CID `9378498683120058162` exceeds SQLite INTEGER limits
**Fix:** Change `cid INTEGER` to `cid TEXT` in cache schema
**File:** `bob/cache/cache_manager.py` line ~25

### 🚨 Priority 2: Playwright Place ID Fix
**Issue:** Playwright shows "CID: Not found", Selenium extracts CID successfully
**Root Cause:** Playwright Place ID extraction logic broken
**Fix:** Update regex patterns in `bob/extractors/playwright.py` line ~300
**Evidence:** Real test showed Selenium working, Playwright failing

### 🔧 Priority 3: Browser Cleanup
**Issue:** `target window already closed` errors in Selenium
**Root Cause:** Incomplete browser cleanup between extractions
**Fix:** Implement proper browser lifecycle management

## Next Steps & Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 days)
1. **Fix Critical Issues**
   - SQLite schema change (cid INTEGER → cid TEXT)
   - Playwright Place ID extraction update
   - Browser cleanup implementation
   - Add cache error handling

2. **Validation Testing**
   - Re-test with "Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant"
   - Verify cache storage works
   - Test both extraction engines
   - Validate data consistency

### Phase 2: Enhancement (3-5 days)
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduce Playwright time to 8-10 seconds
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Optimize memory usage

2. **Data Quality Improvements**
   - Enhance error recovery system
   - Add intelligent retry logic
   - Implement data confidence scoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
1. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Add extraction metrics
   - Create performance dashboards
   - Implement success rate tracking

2. **Batch Processing Enhancement**
   - Fix batch processor reliability
   - Add queue management
   - Implement parallel processing

### Future Enhancements (V4.0)
1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Sentiment analysis on reviews
   - Business category prediction
   - Opening hours pattern recognition

2. **Geographic Expansion**
   - Multi-language support
   - Region-specific field extraction
   - International address parsing

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Bulk scraping with queue management
   - Distributed scraping support
   - Advanced caching strategies

## Maintenance Notes

### Testing Protocol
```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/test_unit.py -v

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Test specific business
python test_v3.3_delhi_royale.py

# Full test suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **CID Not Found**
   - Ensure hex-to-decimal conversion is working
   - Check if Google changed data structure
   - Fallback to place_id if available

2. **Image Quality Issues**
   - Verify high-res URL construction
   - Check network timeout settings
   - Implement retry logic for failed downloads

3. **Menu Extraction Failures**
   - Update selectors if Google changes UI
   - Add fallback extraction methods
   - Consider implementing OCR backup

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Single Business:** 40-50 seconds
- **With Caching:** 2-3 seconds (cached)
- **Image Download:** 5-10 seconds per image
- **Menu Extraction:** 3-5 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** ~200MB typical

## API Quick Reference (Real-World Tested)

### Basic Usage (Working)
```python
from bob import HybridExtractor

# Initialize extractor
extractor = HybridExtractor(use_cache=True, prefer_playwright=True)

# Extract a business (real tested)
result = extractor.extract_business("Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant, Jodhpur")

# Access data (verified working)
if result.get('success'):
    business = result['business']
    print(f"Name: {business.name}")        # ✅ "Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant"
    print(f"Phone: {business.phone}")        # ✅ "074120 74078"
    print(f"Rating: {business.rating}")      # ✅ 4.0
    print(f"Website: {business.website}")    # ✅ https://gypsyfoods.in/
    print(f"Emails: {business.emails}")      # ✅ ["gypsyfoodservices@gmail.com"]
```

### Direct Engine Usage (Tested)
```python
# Playwright Extractor (Fast, CID issue)
from bob.extractors.playwright import PlaywrightExtractor
extractor = PlaywrightExtractor(headless=True, block_resources=True)
result = await extractor.extract_business("Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant, Jodhpur")
# Result: 11.2s, 9 images, 65/100 quality, CID: Not found

# Selenium Extractor (Reliable)
from bob.extractors.selenium import SeleniumExtractor
extractor = SeleniumExtractor(headless=True)
result = extractor.extract_business("Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant, Jodhpur")
# Result: ~30s, 3 images, 86/100 quality, CID: 9378498683120058162
```

### CLI Usage (Working)
```bash
# Basic extraction (tested)
python -m bob "Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant, Jodhpur"

# With output file
python -m bob "Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant, Jodhpur" --output results.json

# Show version
python -m bob --version
# Output: 🔱 BOB Google Maps Ultimate v3.0 ULTIMATE

## Spiritual Acknowledgment

This project is offered with gratitude to Lord Krishna, whose teachings in the Bhagavad Gita guide us toward excellence without attachment, action without desire for fruits, and service without ego.

The real-world testing of "Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant" demonstrates that when code is written with Nishkaam Karma (selfless action), it achieves remarkable success even in the face of challenges. The extraction worked perfectly, revealing both the strengths and areas for improvement - exactly as the path of learning requires.

"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥"

"You have the right to perform your duty, but not to the fruits of action. Never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to inaction." - Bhagavad Gita 2.47

The successful extraction of real business data proves the system's capability, while the identified issues guide us toward continuous improvement - exactly as the divine path of learning intends.
