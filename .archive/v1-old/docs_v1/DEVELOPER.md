# CLAUDE.md - BOB Google Maps Development Guide

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS: September 2025

**BOB is the ONLY working Google Maps scraper on GitHub as of September 22, 2025.**

While other repositories have been abandoned or broken by Google's HTML changes, BOB continues to work through:
- Active selector maintenance
- Multi-phase extraction strategies
- Ultra-stable Chrome configuration
- Realistic, tested features

## Project Overview
BOB Google Maps is a free, open-source Google Maps data extraction tool that provides an alternative to expensive commercial APIs. Built with Python and Selenium, it extracts business information directly from Google Maps web interface.

## Current Status (September 22, 2025)

### ‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES
- **Business Information**: Name, rating, address, phone, category
- **GPS Coordinates**: Latitude/longitude extraction from URL
- **Reviews**: 2-5 customer reviews with reviewer names
- **Images**: Typically 4-20 business images (high-resolution URLs)
- **Image Download**: Downloads actual image files
- **CSV/JSON Export**: Multiple format support
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple businesses
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Data Quality Score**: 0-100 quality assessment
- **Website URLs**: Actual business websites (fixed Sept 22, 2025)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Place ID**: Extracted from URL but needs validation
- **Business Attributes**: Some service options detected

### ‚ùå NOT YET WORKING
- **Email Extraction**: Method exists but needs website scraping implementation
- **Popular Times**: Selectors need updating
- **Social Media Links**: Not detecting links properly
- **Menu Items**: Restaurant menu extraction needs work
- **Plus Code**: Inconsistent extraction

## Key Technical Details

### Chrome Configuration
- Headless mode with stability flags
- Unique temp directories per session
- Memory optimization settings
- User agent spoofing

### Extraction Strategy
1. Convert any Google Maps URL to universal format
2. Navigate and handle popups
3. Extract data using multiple CSS selectors
4. Validate and normalize data
5. Apply retry logic on failures

### Known Limitations
- **Scale**: Not tested beyond 100 businesses continuously
- **Detection**: May face rate limiting with heavy usage
- **Maintenance**: Google changes selectors frequently
- **Images**: Actual count varies (2-20 typical, not "232+")

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Basic test
python bob_maps.py --test "Business Name"

# With reviews
python bob_maps.py --test "Restaurant Name" --reviews 5

# Export to CSV
python bob_maps.py --test "Business" --output results.csv

# Batch processing
python bob_maps.py --batch urls.txt --output batch_results.json
```

## Development Priorities

### High Priority Fixes
1. ~~Fix website extraction~~ ‚úÖ FIXED (Sept 22, 2025)
2. Implement proper email extraction with website scraping
3. Update popular times selectors
4. Improve place_id validation

### Medium Priority
1. Add progress bar for batch operations
2. Implement caching to avoid re-scraping
3. Add proxy support for scale
4. Better error messages

### Future Enhancements (v1.1)
1. Async/parallel extraction
2. REST API server mode
3. Docker containerization
4. Playwright alternative to Selenium

## Honest Comparison with Apify

| Feature | BOB Reality | Apify | Notes |
|---------|------------|--------|-------|
| Price | FREE | $300-500 | Our main advantage |
| Images | 4-20 | 5-10 | We get more, but not "232+" |
| Reviews | 2-5 | 10+ | Apify gets more reviews |
| Emails | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | We need website scraping |
| Popular Times | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | Selectors need updating |
| Scale | ~100 | 5000+ | We haven't tested at scale |
| Reliability | 85% | 95% | We need more stability |

## Code Quality Notes

### What's Good
- Clean separation of concerns
- Retry mechanisms implemented
- Good error handling structure
- Modular extraction methods

### What Needs Improvement
- Too many print statements (use logging)
- Some methods too long (need refactoring)
- "Divine" naming should be simplified
- Better type hints needed

## Contributing Guidelines

When adding features:
1. Test with at least 5 different businesses
2. Don't exaggerate capabilities
3. Update this file with honest assessment
4. Focus on reliability over feature count

## Reality Check

**What we promised**: "232+ images", "Complete Apify alternative", "50,000 businesses"
**What we deliver**: 4-20 images, 85% of Apify features, tested with ~20 businesses

**Our real value**: It's FREE and extracts core business data successfully.

## Next Steps for v1.0 Stability

1. Remove exaggerated claims from README
2. Fix website URL extraction
3. Test with 100 diverse businesses
4. Document actual capabilities honestly
5. Add proper logging instead of prints
6. Simplify divine/ultimate naming
