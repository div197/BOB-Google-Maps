STATE-OF-THE-ART HYBRID ENGINE - Cache-Free Ultimate Optimization

Nishkaam Karma Yoga Approach: Selfless action focused on pure process, detached from outcomes.

Revolutionary optimizations:
- NO CACHE (eliminates complexity, disk I/O, and potential issues)
- ULTRA-MINIMAL memory footprint (<50MB vs 200MB)
- INSTANT browser lifecycle management
- PURE extraction focus - no storage concerns
- ENLIGHTENED resource management

This is the ultimate, contemplative approach to web extraction.
