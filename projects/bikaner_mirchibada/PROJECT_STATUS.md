businesses = [
    "Lalgarh Palace",
    "Jai Mahal Palace",
    "Fort Bikaner",
    "Hotel Pearl Palace",
    # ... 46-96 more
]

processor = BatchProcessor()
results = processor.process_batch(
    businesses,
    delay_between=15,  # 15 seconds between requests
    verbose=True
)

# Export to CSV
# Save to CRM
# Analyze results
```

**Expected Results:**
- 50-100 complete business profiles
- 80-90% success rate
