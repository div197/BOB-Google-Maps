## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Works Well
✅ Search for businesses with exact names
✅ Extraction quality is excellent (75-90+)
✅ Performance is fast and memory-efficient
✅ Data completeness is high (95%+)
✅ Reviews and photos extracted reliably

### What Needs Attention
⚠️ Some businesses hard to find by search alone
⚠️ Google Maps search results vary by region
⚠️ IP blocking after 150-200 requests
✅ Solution: Use delays, randomization, proxies

### Recommendations
1. **Use Exact Business Names** when possible
2. **Implement Smart Delays** (15-30 seconds) between requests
3. **Plan for IP Blocking** after ~200 requests
4. **Use Proxy Service** for 500+ businesses ($50/month)
5. **Validate Data Quality** on sample before full extraction
