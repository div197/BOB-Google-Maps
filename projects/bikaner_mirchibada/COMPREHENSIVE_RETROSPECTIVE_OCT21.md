## ‚ùå WHAT'S MISSING OR NEEDS WORK

### **CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)**

#### 1. Email Extraction Not Working ‚ùå
**Status**: Framework ready, but not extracting

**What's Needed:**
- Parse Google redirect wrapper on website URL
- Implement direct website HTTP GET
- Handle timeouts gracefully
- Test with real websites

**Current Problem:**
```
Website extracted: https://www.google.com/url?q=http://...
Should be: http://www.lallgarhpalace.com/
```

**Impact**: Can't extract business emails (5-point quality loss)

**Fix Effort**: 1-2 hours implementation + testing

---

#### 2. GPS Coordinate Extraction Failing ‚ùå
**Status**: Framework ready with geopy, but geocoding timing out

**What's Needed:**
- Implement timeout retry logic
- Add fallback geocoding service
- Cache geocoding results
- Handle network issues gracefully

**Current Problem:**
```
Input: "28RJ+6F3, Samta Nagar, Bikaner, Rajasthan 334001"
Expected: {lat: 28.02, lon: 71.64}
Actual: Timeout/None
```

**Impact**: Can't get GPS for mapping (8-point quality loss)

**Fix Effort**: 2-3 hours implementation + testing

---

#### 3. Business Hours Detection Not Working ‚ùå
**Status**: Framework ready with patterns, but no detection

**What's Needed:**
- Enhance regex patterns for more formats
- Implement hours parsing logic
- Handle edge cases (24/7, holidays, etc.)
- Validate extracted hours

**Current Problem:**
- HTML patterns not matching
- Need more robust hour detection

**Impact**: Can't get business hours (5-point quality loss)

**Fix Effort**: 2-3 hours implementation + testing

---

### **IMPORTANT GAPS (Should Address)**

#### 1. No Batch Processing Script
**Status**: Individual extraction works, but no batch processor

**What's Needed:**
- Create batch_processor.py for 50-100 businesses
- Implement rate limiting (15-30s delays)
- Add error handling and retry logic
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Export to CRM format (CSV)

**Impact**: Can't do Phase 3 bulk extraction efficiently

**Fix Effort**: 3-4 hours

---

#### 2. No CRM Export Format
**Status**: Data extracted but no CRM integration

**What's Needed:**
- Define CRM output format (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Create export functions
- Field mapping for common CRM systems
- Test with standard CRM tools

**Impact**: Data not ready for immediate CRM import

**Fix Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

#### 3. No Performance Dashboard
**Status**: Metrics captured, but no overview

**What's Needed:**
- Create execution summary script
- Performance metrics tracking
- Quality score analysis
- Success rate reporting
- Time tracking per business

**Impact**: Hard to see progress/quality across batches

**Fix Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

#### 4. Limited Error Handling
**Status**: Basic error handling, but needs improvement

**What's Needed:**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed error logging
- Retry mechanisms with backoff
- Fallback strategies per field

**Impact**: One failure stops entire batch

**Fix Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

#### 5. No Data Validation
**Status**: No post-extraction validation

**What's Needed:**
- Validate phone numbers (format, country code)
- Validate email addresses (format, DNS)
- Validate addresses (completeness, format)
- Validate websites (accessibility)

**Impact**: Might include invalid data

**Fix Effort**: 3-4 hours

---

### **NICE-TO-HAVE GAPS (Can Add Later)**
