## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

### Phase 3 Launcher Configuration

Edit `phase_3_launcher_v34.py`:

```python
# Line in launcher.launch_phase_3():
results = launcher.launch_phase_3(business_count=100)  # Set count here
```

### Batch Processor Configuration

Edit `batch_processor_v34.py`:

```python
# Line in __init__():
self.batch_processor = BatchProcessorV34(
    rate_limit_seconds=20,      # Seconds between businesses
    max_retries=2,               # Retry attempts
    verbose=True                 # Detailed logging
)
```

### Custom Business List

Replace the business list generation with your own:

```python
# In phase_3_launcher_v34.py, replace generate_bikaner_business_list():
def load_custom_business_list(self, filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]

# Usage:
business_list = launcher.load_custom_business_list('my_businesses.txt')
results = launcher.batch_processor.process_batch(business_list)
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Progress Tracking

The launcher shows real-time progress:
```
[HH:MM:SS] INFO     Extracting: Business Name
[HH:MM:SS] SUCCESS  ✅ SUCCESS: Business Name
[HH:MM:SS] RATE_LIMIT ⏸️ Rate limiting: waiting 20s...
```

### Output Files

Results saved to:
```
projects/bikaner_mirchibada/data/
├── batch_results_TIMESTAMP.json
├── batch_results_TIMESTAMP.csv
└── PHASE_3_CONFIG.json
```

### Batch Statistics

After completion, view summary:
```
📊 BATCH PROCESSING SUMMARY
Total processed: 100
Successful: 98 (98.0%)
Failed: 2 (2.0%)
Average quality score: 70.2/100
Processing time: 2134s (21.3s per business)
```

---

## 🔄 Resuming Interrupted Processing

If processing is interrupted, check:
```bash
ls -lh projects/bikaner_mirchibada/data/batch_results*.json
```

The last JSON file contains all processed businesses. Resume with:
```python
# Load previous results
with open('batch_results_TIMESTAMP.json') as f:
    previous = json.load(f)

# Continue with remaining businesses
remaining = [b for b in all_businesses if b not in previous['processed']]
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Slow processing (>30s per business)
**Solution:** Check your network connection and system resources

### Issue: Memory usage high
**Solution:** Process fewer businesses at a time (e.g., 50 instead of 100)

### Issue: Many extraction failures
**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify business names are spelled correctly
3. Check if Google Maps has data for the business

### Issue: Low email detection
**Solution:**
1. Check if businesses have websites
2. Email extraction works best with well-structured websites
3. 60-70% detection is normal

### Issue: GPS not found
**Solution:**
1. GPS needs precise address format
2. Current detection: 30-40% normal
3. Will improve with Google Maps API integration

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Phase 3

### Immediate (After 100+ processing):
1. Review results in CSV/JSON
2. Check quality scores
3. Verify sample data manually
4. Adjust extraction parameters if needed

### Short-term (Next week):
1. Import leads to CRM
2. De-duplicate if needed
3. Enrich with additional data
4. Create targeted campaigns

### Medium-term (Next month):
1. Real-time CRM synchronization
2. Automated quality monitoring
3. Machine learning for field prediction
4. API integration for continuous updates

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Phase 3 Success Criteria ✅
- ✅ Process 100+ businesses successfully
- ✅ Maintain 90%+ quality score average
- ✅ Export to CRM formats without errors
- ✅ Complete within estimated time
- ✅ Zero regressions to existing system

---

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Process 50 Bikaner Businesses
```python
# phase_3_launcher_v34.py
launcher.launch_phase_3(business_count=50)
```

### Example 2: Load Custom Business List
```python
# Custom list from file
businesses = []
with open('my_businesses.txt') as f:
    businesses = [line.strip() for line in f]

# Process
results = launcher.batch_processor.process_batch(businesses)

# Export
exports = launcher.crm_exporter.export_all_formats(results)
```

### Example 3: Check Results
```bash
# View summary
cat projects/bikaner_mirchibada/data/batch_results_TIMESTAMP.json | python -m json.tool

# View CSV
head -20 projects/bikaner_mirchibada/data/batch_results_TIMESTAMP.csv

# Get statistics
python3 -c "import json; r = json.load(open('...json')); print(f\"Success: {r['summary']['successful']}/{r['summary']['total_processed']}\")"
```

## 🔐 Best Practices

1. **Always backup results:**
   ```bash
   cp projects/bikaner_mirchibada/data/batch_results_*.json backup/
   ```

2. **Monitor resource usage:**
   - Watch memory: Should stay <100MB
   - Watch disk: Each result is ~1KB JSON
   - Watch network: Rate limiting prevents blocking

3. **Log processing:**
   - Enable verbose mode for detailed logging
   - Save console output for debugging
   - Check PHASE_3_CONFIG.json for metadata

4. **Verify results:**
   - Spot check 10-20 results manually
   - Compare with Google Maps directly
   - Validate email addresses are correct
