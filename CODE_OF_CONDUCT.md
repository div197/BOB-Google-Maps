## 🧘 Philosophy: Nishkaam Karma Yoga

This project is built on the principles of **Nishkaam Karma Yoga** from the Bhagavad Gita:

> **कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन**
>
> "You have the right to perform your duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions."

In the context of this community, this means:

1. **Focus on the Action, Not the Recognition**
   - Contribute for the joy of building, not for fame
   - Help others without expecting anything in return
   - Share knowledge freely

2. **Selfless Collaboration**
   - Support fellow contributors
   - Share credit generously
   - Celebrate community success over individual achievement

3. **Detachment from Outcomes**
   - Accept that not all PRs will be merged
   - Learn from feedback without taking it personally
   - Understand that rejection of code is not rejection of the person

4. **Duty with Excellence**
   - Write the best code you can
   - Document thoroughly
   - Test comprehensively
   - Not for praise, but because it's the right thing to do

## 🚫 Unacceptable Interaction Examples

```

## 💡 Conflict Resolution

If you experience or witness a conflict:

1. **Stay Calm** - Take a step back before responding
2. **Assume Good Intent** - Most conflicts arise from miscommunication
3. **Communicate Clearly** - Express your concerns respectfully
4. **Seek Mediation** - If needed, ask project maintainers for help
5. **Focus on Solutions** - Move toward resolution, not blame

## 🌱 Growth Mindset

We encourage a growth mindset in our community:

- **Mistakes are learning opportunities** - We all make them
- **Questions are welcome** - No question is too basic
- **Feedback helps us grow** - Give and receive it gracefully
- **We're all learners** - Even maintainers are continuously learning

## 🌏 Diversity and Inclusion
