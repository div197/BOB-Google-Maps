## ⚠️ 10 Architectural Limitations (RAJAS Code - 20%)

1. **Dependency Fragility** - 3 different browser frameworks
2. **Cache Hit Rate Uncertainty** - Estimated but NOT measured
3. **Async/Await Complexity** - Event loop juggling, nested asyncio.run()
4. **Limited Real-Time Monitoring** - No dashboard, no analytics
5. **Configuration Complexity** - 3-layer system, hard to trace
6. **No Async Batch Processing** - Sequential only (3-5x speedup possible)
7. **Email Extraction Is Basic** - Google links only
8. **No Distributed Architecture** - Single-machine only
9. **Limited Place ID Validation** - Pattern matching only
10. **Test Coverage Gap** - Missing E2E and regression tests

---

## 🚀 Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate Wins (2-3 days each)
1. **Async Batch Processing** → 3-5x speedup
2. **Email Extraction Enhancement** → 2-3x more emails
3. **Place ID Cross-Validation** → 99%+ accuracy

### Medium-term (3-5 days)
4. **Redis Caching Layer** → 10-100x distributed cache speedup

### Long-term (1-2 weeks)
5. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard** → Production visibility
6. **Distributed Architecture** → Multi-machine scaling
