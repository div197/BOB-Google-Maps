## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic Extraction
```python
from bob import HybridExtractor

# Initialize extractor
extractor = HybridExtractor(use_cache=True, prefer_playwright=True)

# Extract a business by URL
url = "https://maps.google.com/?cid=4679876402555262750"
result = extractor.extract_business(url, include_reviews=True, max_reviews=5)

# Access data
if result.get('success'):
    business = result.get('business')
    print(f"Name: {business.name}")
    print(f"Rating: {business.rating}")           # NEW in 1.0!
    print(f"CID: {business.cid}")                 # NEW in 1.0!
    print(f"Emails: {business.emails}")           # NEW in 1.0!
    print(f"Plus Code: {business.plus_code}")     # NEW in 1.0!
    print(f"Service Options: {business.service_options}")  # NEW in 1.0!
    print(f"Quality Score: {business.data_quality_score}/100")
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
from bob import HybridExtractor, PlaywrightExtractor, SeleniumExtractor

# Option 1: Hybrid Extractor (Recommended - Maximum Reliability)
extractor = HybridExtractor(
    use_cache=True,           # Enable intelligent caching
    prefer_playwright=True    # Try Playwright first, fallback to Selenium
)

# Option 2: Direct Playwright (Fastest)
extractor = PlaywrightExtractor(
    headless=True,            # Run in headless mode
    block_resources=True,     # Block images/fonts for speed
    intercept_network=True    # Intercept network for data extraction
)

# Option 3: Direct Selenium (Most Compatible)
extractor = SeleniumExtractor(
    headless=True,
    stealth_mode=True         # Enhanced stealth mode
)

# Batch processing with URLs
urls = [
    "https://maps.google.com/?cid=123456789",
    "https://maps.google.com/?cid=987654321",
    "https://maps.google.com/?cid=456789123"
]

# Sequential extraction
results = []
for url in urls:
    result = extractor.extract_business(url)
    if result.get('success'):
        business = result['business']
        results.append(business)
        print(f"‚úì Extracted: {business.name}")

# Parallel extraction (HybridExtractor only - 10x faster!)
results = extractor.extract_multiple(urls, parallel=True, max_concurrent=5)
```

### Batch Processing with BatchProcessor
```python
from bob import BatchProcessor

# Initialize batch processor
processor = BatchProcessor(
    headless=True,           # Run in headless mode
    include_reviews=False,   # Skip reviews for faster processing
    max_reviews=0
)

# Define business URLs
urls = [
    "https://maps.google.com/?cid=123456789",
    "https://maps.google.com/?cid=987654321",
    "https://maps.google.com/?cid=456789123"
]

# Process batch with subprocess isolation (100% reliability)
results = processor.process_batch(
    businesses=urls,
    verbose=True,            # Show progress
    delay_between=1          # 1 second delay between requests
)

# Process batch with automatic retry
results = processor.process_batch_with_retry(
    businesses=urls,
    max_retries=1,           # Retry failed extractions once
    verbose=True
)

# Analyze results
successful = [r for r in results if r.get('success')]
print(f"\nSuccessfully extracted: {len(successful)}/{len(results)} businesses")

# Save results
import json
with open('batch_results.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)
```

### With Error Handling
```python
from bob import HybridExtractor

extractor = HybridExtractor()

try:
    url = "https://maps.google.com/?cid=123456789"
    result = extractor.extract_business(url, include_reviews=True, max_reviews=5)

    if result.get('success'):
        business = result['business']
        # Calculate quality score
        quality_score = business.calculate_quality_score()

        if quality_score >= 80:
            print(f"High quality data extracted! Score: {quality_score}/100")
            print(f"Name: {business.name}")
            print(f"Rating: {business.rating}")
            print(f"Reviews: {len(business.reviews)}")
        else:
            print(f"Data quality: {quality_score}/100 - Some fields missing")
    else:
        print(f"Extraction failed: {result.get('error')}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

# Get extraction statistics
stats = extractor.get_stats()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {stats.get('cache_hit_rate', '0%')}")
print(f"Success rate: {stats.get('success_rate', '0%')}")
```

### Working with Business Objects
```python
from bob import HybridExtractor, Business

extractor = HybridExtractor()
result = extractor.extract_business("https://maps.google.com/?cid=123456789")

if result.get('success'):
    business = result['business']  # Business object

    # Access fields directly
    print(f"Name: {business.name}")
    print(f"Rating: {business.rating}")
    print(f"CID: {business.cid}")
    print(f"Place ID: {business.place_id}")
    print(f"Emails: {business.emails}")
    print(f"Plus Code: {business.plus_code}")
    print(f"Service Options: {business.service_options}")

    # Calculate quality score
    score = business.calculate_quality_score()
    print(f"Data Quality: {score}/100")

    # Convert to dictionary
    data = business.to_dict()

    # Save as JSON
    import json
    with open('business_data.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2, default=str)
```
