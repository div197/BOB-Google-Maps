result2 = extractor.extract_business("Starbucks Times Square")
```

### Export to CSV

```python
import pandas as pd

results = [extractor.extract_business(name) for name in queries]
df = pd.DataFrame([
    {
        'name': r['business'].name,
        'phone': r['business'].phone,
        'address': r['business'].address,
        'rating': r['business'].rating

  default_engine: "hybrid"      # playwright, selenium, or hybrid
  include_reviews: false        # Include full review text
  timeout: 30                   # Extraction timeout (seconds)
  max_concurrent: 3             # Parallel extractions

memory:
  optimized: true              # Use memory optimization
  max_concurrent: 1            # Limit concurrent operations

cache:
  enabled: true                # Use SQLite cache
  expiration_hours: 24         # Cache validity period
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Scalability:           Handles 1000+ businesses/day
```

## 🌐 Website Extraction Technology - The Breakthrough

### The Problem We Solved

Google Maps often displays provider URLs instead of actual business websites:
- **Provider Chooser URLs:** `https://www.google.com/viewer/chooseprovider?mid=...`
- **Maps Reservation URLs:** `https://www.google.com/maps/reserve?...`
- **Booking Platform Redirects:** Links to Zomato, TripAdvisor, booking.com instead of the actual business website

This prevented proper email extraction, business validation, and data enrichment.

### The Solution: Intelligent Multi-Tier Filtering

BOB implements a sophisticated 3-tier website extraction architecture:

**Tier 1: Raw Collection**
- Extracts ALL available URLs from the business page (8-10 URLs per business)
- Collects from multiple CSS selectors: `a[data-item-id='authority']`, `a[href*='http']`, etc.
- Deduplicates results

**Tier 2: Intelligent Filtering** ⭐
- Blocks 45+ patterns of invalid URLs:
  - Google internal URLs (viewer, maps, reserve, aclk, etc.)
  - Booking platforms (Zomato, Swiggy, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Yelp, Uber Eats, Deliveroo, etc.)
  - Social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube - not primary websites)
  - Review sites (Trustpilot, Glassdoor, G2)
  - Email addresses and localhost
- Scores URLs by type: Direct URLs > Pattern-based > Redirects
- Parses Google redirect URLs to extract actual domains from `q=` parameter

**Tier 3: Pattern-Based Fallback**
- Searches page text for patterns: "website: ...", "visit: ...", "contact: ..."
- Extracts direct URLs from page content using regex
- Validates all extracted URLs against blocked keywords

### Real-World Results (November 2025)

**5-Business Validation Test:**

| Business | Result | Confidence |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant | ✅ http://www.gypsyfoods.com/ | 98/100 |
| Janta Sweet House | ✅ https://jantasweethome.com/ | 88/100 |
| Niro's Restaurant | ✅ http://www.nirosindia.com/ | 98/100 |
| Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar | ✅ http://www.lmbsweets.com/ | 88/100 |
| Surya Mahal | ⚠️ No real website on listing | Edge case |

**Success Rate:** 4/5 (80%) extracted real business domains
**Quality Improvement:** 3-30/100 (before) → 88-98/100 (after)

### Technical Implementation

The intelligent filtering is implemented in:
- **`bob/utils/website_extractor.py`** - Filtering logic and URL validation
- **`bob/extractors/playwright_optimized.py`** - PRIMARY engine integration
- **`bob/extractors/selenium_optimized.py`** - FALLBACK engine integration

Key functions:
```python
def extract_website_intelligent(page_text, available_urls):
    """Multi-layer extraction with 45+ blocked keywords"""

def parse_google_redirect(google_url):
    """Extract actual URL from google.com/url?q=... wrapper"""

def _is_valid_business_url(url):
    """Validate against blocked patterns (45+ keywords)"""
```

### Impact on Email & Image Extraction

With proper website extraction in place:
- ✅ **Email Extraction:** Can now fetch and parse business websites safely
- ✅ **Data Validation:** Prevents invalid email extraction from Google URLs
- ✅ **Business Verification:** Confirms actual business domain vs intermediaries

### Architectural Advantages

1. **Multi-Strategy Approach** - Not reliant on single CSS selector
2. **Resilient to Google Changes** - Works across different Google Maps layouts
3. **Validation Safety** - Prevents false positives and data corruption
4. **Pattern Fallback** - Alternative extraction method if primary fails
5. **Google Redirect Parsing** - Unwraps Google's URL parameter masking
