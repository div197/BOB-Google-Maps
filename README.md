- ✅ **Universal CID** - Handles ALL Place ID formats
- ✅ **Completely FREE** - $0 vs $850-1,600 API costs

## 🔑 Unique Features Only BOB Has

### 1. Universal CID System
Converts ALL Place ID formats to consistent identifiers:
- ChIJ format → CID
- Hex format (0x:0x) → CID
- GhIJ format → CID
- Numeric → CID

### 2. Image Extraction (Impossible via API!)
- Google Maps API: **0 images**
- BOB: **4-20 real business images**
- Worth using for images alone

### 3. Still Working (September 2025)
- Other repos: Last updated 2023-2024, broken
- BOB: Active selectors, working extraction

## 📝 The Truth About BOB

### What We Promised Before vs Reality:
- ❌ "232+ images" → ✅ **4-20 images** (still more than API!)
- ❌ "50,000 tested" → ✅ **~100 tested** (but it works!)
- ❌ "Enterprise ready" → ✅ **Research/small-scale ready**

### Why We're Still Valuable:
1. **We're FREE** - Others cost $300-1,600
2. **We WORK** - All other GitHub scrapers broken
3. **We extract IMAGES** - Google API can't do this
4. **We're HONEST** - Clear about capabilities
